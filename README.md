# CSCI-321-Game-Project
The video game that we created for our game programming class in Fall 2022
Note: This game was made for an older version of Unity, and after some testing, I cannot get it to work; this is more to show that I have something that did work and just got outdated by Unity's versions. There is a video in the repository that contains a playthrough of the game to showcase what we did.
